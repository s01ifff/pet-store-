        <h2>Meet Geronimo</h2>
    </body>
    <body> 
        <p>Geronimo is a tiny hamster with a big personality! He might be small, but he’s always on the move—running on his wheel, stuffing his cheeks with snacks, and exploring every corner of his cage.

He’s super curious and loves to climb, dig, and peek out from his hidey spots to see what’s going on. Watching him build little nests or carry food is honestly the cutest thing ever.

Geronimo isn’t a fan of loud noises or being picked up too quickly, but with a gentle hand and some tasty treats, he’ll come say hi and maybe even sit in your hand for a bit.

If you’re looking for a fun little buddy to watch and care for, Geronimo is your guy!
